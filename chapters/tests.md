###karma

####Testing purpose

#####unit tests

#####integration tests

#####end2end tests

I had the plan to implement complete test szenarios from unit, inetgration and acceptance tests over all layers.
The goal is that karma frontend tests with angularjs ngScenario runs against a full feature backend so that this 
goals
* the angularjs (controllers, services, views maybe directives) code is tests
* the communication and integration with the backend api
* and the root code path of the backend code
will be achieved.

During my work as a developer i saw a lot of good and bad things about testing. Of course the worst scenario is that there is no automated tests but i saw also that there was near 100 times more test code than functional code and 90 times of that were unit test with mocking all the world around them. So the best i guess is to keep it balanced have a lot of unit tests is good but you should also have some integrations or to be clear acceptance tests. So that you test also the integration between layers and maybe systems.
For that project it means to have a test coverage near 90 percent for the backend and the frontend itself. Means test the frontend without interaction with the backend and the backend without frontend requets. 

But i guess what is more important also for a multilanguage project is that the interaction/communication between frontend and backen is also very well tested. To achieved this very good point i will describe it here how i set it up that the angularjs ngScenario tests are running against a fullfeatured play 2 backend with of course test data in the database but nothing is mocked there except 3rd party communication like google plus oauth2 login. The End2End test should be run local and on the ci system (i used travis and that support karma testing out of the box with some setup little setup)

extraction of the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/pussinboots/bankapp/blob/master/.travis.yml) file
```
- export DISPLAY=:99.0
- sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start
```
It start a X window system what is needed to perform in browser tests. The firefox is preinstalled on the travis ci default vm images. But it is also possible to install other browsers they run under unix system.

extraction of the [.travis.yml]()from an other poroject
```
- sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list'
- sudo sh -c 'wget -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | apt-key add -'
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install opera
```
It will install the opera browser. If you interested in [browser compatibility](https://saucelabs.com/) tests that look at the [saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) company. It is also very easy to setup with travis and karma. But that it a other topic that could be an extension of the e2e test topic afterwards

At the moment not covered yet maybe solved in the near future
* e2e test coverage measurement
* 3rd party integration testing
* automated testing of the productaion systems (maybe this can be arranged with a liitle extension of the e2e testing described here)
You as a reader of course can send me your feedback or idears about this topics may also your solutions how you handle that.

Test definition for me

* unit test test code without external dependencies
* integration test test multile code blocks without external dependencies
* acceptance test test functions of the complete system without external dependencies but mocked in proper way  

This project is implemented as a web application that target browsers and mobile devices (start with android).
For the frontend the javascript programming language is choosed because it plays well with HTML5 features and has a wide 
community and framework support. The backend is impleented with Scala specialy play 2 framework because less coding than java and good development suport of play like class reloading, test support, and so on.

* frontend angularjs 1.2.x version
* backend play 2.2.3 scala

####Frontend

As i mentioned it is implemented with javascript and the wonderful web framework [anularjs](https://angularjs.org/). The angularjs framework make it very simple to build html 5 featured web applications with little lines of codes and a wide support of plugings called modules in the anularjs world.

######Unit Test

TODO document and imlement with karma the common way

######Integration Tests

TODO maybe not needed because can be achieved with acceptance test for the whole system frontend plus backend

####Backend

######Unit Test

Implements standard play 2 unit tests see test/unit folder
TODO document 

######Integration Tests

Implements standard play 2 integration tests see test/integration folder
TODO document 

####Acceptance Tests

##Setup

####karma runner as npm test script

TODO document that is the magic where to document the way to write karma e2e test that run against the play 2 backend  

file bliss ignore child exit code so that if a command returns other exit code than zero the command pipe will not break it execution
```
#!/bin/sh
"$@"
exit 0
```

The bliss script is used to prevent the break of the command pipe. So ignore the exit code of the play stop command which can be 1 if the RUNNING_PID file was not found. So that means stop a running play server or do nothing and than start a new one with the e2e application configuration in the background and the following wget command wait until the server is up and running by check if the http://localhost:9000 call was succesful. Than run the karma e2e tests and if all tests passed than stop the running play server. The play stop command is only performed if all tests passed so a test run could leave you a running server. To prevent that play stop is the first command here. This 
extraction from [package.json](https://github.com/pussinboots/bankapp/blob/master/package.json) file
```
{
...
  "scripts": {
    "test": "./bliss play stop && play -Dconfig.file=conf/application-e2e.conf start & wget -O/dev/null --retry-connrefused --tries=40 http://localhost:9000 && ./node_modules/.bin/karma start karma.conf-e2e.js --single-run && play stop"
  }
...
}

```
###### Little hint for local development

The npm test run should also work with a local development but it need some times to start and stop the play server. To get the maximum speed for development you should start the play server with the run command, because play start has no reload feature and also static files are cached. 
```
play -Dconfig.file=conf/application-e2e.conf run 
```
And to start the karma e2e test run.
```
./node_modules/.bin/karma start karma.conf-e2e.js
```
So with this commands you can still change the backend and frontend code (means scala and javascript, html, css, ...) and the e2e test will run against your latest changes. That means you can really programm in a TDD style.

```
play ~test
```
To get the full TDD power you should also start your play tests in continuous mode so that they are executed for every code change you did. But there are still some drawbacks the karma runner doesn't detect your changes of the scala code and the recompilation in the play run terminal could take too long for the karma runner so you have to started more times before it will run all your e2e tests or you increase the waiting times of karma (browserNoActivityTimeout)

```
